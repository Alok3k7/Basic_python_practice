# Here are some of the most commonly used basic operators in Python
# 1.Arithmetic Operators:
x = 10  # x as 10 for declaration
y = 3  # y as 3 for declaration
result_add = x + y  # "+"for addition
print(result_add)
result_sub = x - y  # "-" for subtraction
print(result_sub)
result_mul = x * y  # "*" for multiplication
print(result_mul)
result_div = x / y  # "/" for
print(result_div)
result_floor_div = x // y  # "//" for Floor Division (integer division)
print(result_floor_div)
result_mod = x % y  # "%" for reminder
print(result_mod)
result_exp = x ** y  # "**" for Exponentiation
print(result_exp)
# 2.Comparison Operators  ( It print the boolean value )
a = 5  # a as 5 for declaration
b = 10  # b as 10 for declaration
is_equal = a == b  # Equal to: ==
print(is_equal)
is_not_equal = a != b  # Not equal to: !=
print(is_not_equal)
is_greater = a > b  # Greater than: >
print(is_greater)
is_less = a < b  # Less than: <
print(is_less)
is_greater_equal = a >= b  # Greater than equal to :>=
print(is_greater_equal)
is_lesser_equal = a <= b  # lesser than equal to : <=
print(is_lesser_equal)
# 3.Logical Operators:
condition1 = True
condition2 = False
result_and = condition1 and condition2  # logical AND: and
print(result_and)
result_or = condition1 or condition2  # Logical OR: or
print(result_or)
result_not = not condition1  # Logical NOT: not
print(result_not)
# 4 Assignment Operators:
r = 5  # Assignment: =
r += 3  # Add and assign: +=
r -= 2  # Subtract and assign: -=
r *= 4  # Multiply and assign: *=
r /= 1  # Divide and assign: /=
r //= 2  # floor divide and assign: //=
r %= 2  # Modulus and assign: %=
r **= 2  # Exponentiation and assign: **=
