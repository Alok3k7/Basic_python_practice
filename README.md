# Basic Python Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and features of the Python programming language.

## Scripts

- **Basic Operators**: `basic_operators.py` - Examples of basic arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators in Python.
- **Basic String Operations**: `basic_string_operations.py` - Demonstrates basic string operations such as concatenation, indexing, slicing, and formatting.
- **Classes and Objects**: `class_and_object.py` - Introduces classes and objects in Python, including attributes, methods, and inheritance.
- **Code Introspection**: `code_introspection.py` - Explores code introspection techniques in Python, including `dir()`, `type()`, and `help()` functions.
- **Conditions**: `conditions.py` - Covers conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- **Decorators**: `decorator.py` - Introduces decorators in Python, which are a special type of function that can modify or extend the behavior of another function.
- **Dictionaries**: `dictionaries.py` - Demonstrates the use of dictionaries in Python, including creating, accessing, and manipulating dictionary data.
- **Exception Handling**: `exception_handling.py` - Covers exception handling in Python, including `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- **Functions**: `functions.py` - Introduces functions in Python, including function definitions, arguments, and return values.
- **Generators**: `generator.py` - Explores generators in Python, which are a type of iterable that can be used to generate a sequence of values on the fly.
- **Lists**: `list.py` - Demonstrates the use of lists in Python, including creating, indexing, slicing, and manipulating list data.
- **Loops**: `loops.py` - Covers loops in Python, including `for` and `while` loops.
- **Modules and Packages**: `modules_and_packages.py` - Introduces modules and packages in Python, including importing, creating, and using modules and packages.
- **String Formatting**: `string_formatting.py` - Demonstrates string formatting techniques in Python, including `str.format()` and f-strings.
- **Variables**: `variables.py` - Covers variables in Python, including assigning, reassigning, and using variables.
